#+SEQ_TODO: TODO OPTIONAL TEST DONE
* Sanity with Arch Linux and xmonad

In a world where most Linux users revolve around Ubuntu and desktop environments choices (Gnome vs KDE vs …), I’m feeling more and more attracted to something simpler
and more lightweight. And even though my installations of KDE and Gnome were done on a very light Debian system, with almost everything stripped off, I noticed that
they could be even more light: they have more widgets than I need, and more applications than I ever used.

Besides that, my attempt at having a rolling distribution of Debian by pointing it to testing, also meant that my system was far more unstable than I wanted. I got a
rolling distribution but I got a broken system every once in a while.

So I rethought all these constraints and how to accomodate them better with a new distribution. Here’s what I want:

- A distribution which is inherently rolling but where that doesn’t mean loosing stability;
- A distribution which gets me just the bare bare minimum, from where I can iteratively build up;
- A window manager (instead of a desktop environment) which keeps out of the way and is super light on resources.

** So after some reading and experimenting, I decided to go with Arch Linux and xmonad.

Many things contributed to this decision but for sure documentation was one of the main ones for Arch. I had bumped into their wiki accidentally many times before
while trying to solve problems on Debian and the quality is quite good.

As for xmonad, the choice was essentially based on the fact that it was implemented in Haskell, which gives me a chance to play with the source code. The fact that it
is super light on resources definitelly helped, but to be honest I did not look into other alternatives.

So here I am, 24 hours later, writing this blog post on Emacs running on Xmonad on a fresh and light Arch Linux installation. The rest of this post explains how to do
it.

What you should be aware of

Depending on your experience, Arch Linux may be a bit too manual for your taste. You should definitelly read the begginer’s guide, the FAQ and the installation guide
beforehand - the documentation is well written and it gives you a general idea of all the steps you’ll have to go through, which are somewhat different from a Debian
instalation for example.

** There are a few things I think you should prepare ahead of time, even before burning the installation CD, and the docs don’t really mention:

- Find out if your BIOS uses UEFI or not as this is very relevant for the bootloader installation. It will depend on things such as whether you have other operating
  systems installed or not or if you plan to do it eventually;
- Find out to what is your BIOS time synchronized to. Is it UTC or local time?
- Partition your hard disk before you even start this whole process. This one I cannot stress enough – get a gparted Live CD (or whatever you prefer), boot into your
  computer and prepartition it. You’ll get the benefit of doing it in a controlled environment, thinking well ahead of time about how you want to have your partitions.
  Oh and do write down what is each partition, i.e., /dev/sda5 is /, /dev/sda6 is /boot, etc.
- Definitelly do this with the instructions printed or opened on another laptop so that you can search for help if you get stuck.

* DONE The base system
  CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 03:13]

The CD can be downloaded from Arch linux downloads page. Partition your disk, burn Arch into a CD and boot into it. You’ll have a menu at boot time and then you’ll be
logged in as root in a prompt.

** OPTIONAL Activate the keymap you want if you don’t want US english. In my case, for Portuguese:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 loadkeys /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/pt-latin9.map.gz
#+END_SRC
** mount filesystem
Since we already partitioned the disks, let’s format them. In my case, I had 2 extended partitions (sda5 and sda6) under a logical partition, after the Windows 8
partitions:
#+NAME: mnt
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var X="2"
 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda$X
#+END_SRC
** DONE Swap
   CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 02:44]

Now we install the base system onto /mnt. We’ll first vi
/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and leave only the best mirrors.
I left all the ones until 1.5 since those included a
lot of germany and european mirrors, and removed all US mirrors.
It’s important to note that, since I was on a wired connection,
the next step works automatically for shme. I haven’t tried this
on a wireless connection but the documentation explains how to do it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 mkswap /dev/sda6
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
 swapon /dev/sda6
#+END_SRC

** DONE Monut
   CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 02:45]

Let’s mount the partitions. The partition which is going to be / should be mounted on /mnt.
#+NAME: mntto
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var X=""
mount /dev/sda$X /mnt
#+END_SRC


This part takes a little bit. When that’s done it’s time to switch to the newly installed system and finish setting it up:
** DONE Generate fstab
   CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 03:13]
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
genfstab -p -L /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
#+END_SRC

** DONE chrook
   CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 02:45]
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
arch-chroot /mnt
#+END_SRC

* DONE Configaring things
  CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 04:18]
This part of the configuration will surely be different for you but my examples will indicate what you should be doing on your computer:
** DONE Host

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

 Now it’s time to install the boot loader. This will definitelly be different for you if you decide to put GRUB on the beggining of your disk. In my case, it’s in the
beggining of sda5 since Windows won’t cope well with it and for that I had to do some more magic:

* TODO Fix Resulation
 The console will now show up in 640x480 resolution so let’s change that to something nicer. For that we need to know what resolutions our graphics card can handle and
for that we need a tool called hwinfo
**  hwinfo and fix framebuffer
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 pacman -S hwinfo
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results repla
hwinfo --framebuffer
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- Find the line which starts with GRUB_GFXMODE and update it to match the resolution you chose (in my case GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024x24);
- Find the line which starts with GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX and update it to say GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep);
- Add the decimal representation of the hex mode you found with hwinfo to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT like so GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash vga=795
- Recreate the grub configuration with grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg and systemctl reboot


** Expected results
The output will look something like this:
You’ll find some hexadecimal number on the column on the left which you should convert to decimal. In my case, the mode I was interested in was 1280x1024x24, which is
0x031b, which is 795 in decimal. That number should now be added to /etc/default/grub plus the following changes:

* TODO X windows and xmonad

We’ll be installing a window manager, as opposed to a full desktop environment. It’s a good idea to understand the differences between the two. For me, the main reason
to go for a window manager was really performance.
** TODO xorg installations

** DONE Configaring
   CLOSED: [2016-01-24 Sun 03:01]
The default configuration is a bit too white so let’s change it.
These changes are based upon several guides and tutorials found on the
xmonad page, on the Haskell wiki and on the Arch Linux Wiki.
They represent the bare minimum for me but, as with everything in this post, YMMV.

It uses xmobar to have a small text based bar on the top of the screen
and a background image. Nothing more.

***  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
Let’s edit ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs and add the following Haskell code
(remember to replace my references to /home/luis with your home directory):


#+name: rootxmo
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :dir ~
(expand-file-name ".xmobarrc")
#+END_SRC

    , layoutHook = avoidStruts  $  layoutHook defaultConfig
    , logHook = dynamicLogWithPP xmobarPP
    { ppOutput = hPutStrLn xmproc
        , ppTitle = xmobarColor "green" "" . shorten 50 }
    } `additionalKeys`

*** ~/.xinitrc
Finally, find an image you like for background (I’m currently using
this one), download it and edit you ~/.xinitrc:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir ~/dot
wet http://www.simwallpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cool-Car-Pitchers-3.jpg
cp /usr/local/src/literate-devops/job/pic/forcv10.jpg ~/dot/lambda.jpg
ls ~/dot/
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/.xinitrc
#!/bin/sh

# Executed by startx (run your window manager from here)

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
    for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/*; do
        [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
    done
    unset f
fi

# Xresources
[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

# Set the background Image
feh --bg-fill ~/dot/lambda.jpg

# start xscreensaver

# Start xmonad
exec xmonad

#+END_SRC

** OPTIONAL capslog as ctl and ctl alt backspace as kill windows
I made the Caps Lock key and alternative to CTRL key (for emacs) and I set CTRL+ALT+Backspace as
the combination to kill X Windows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 localectl caps:ctrl_modifier,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
#+END_SRC

* Start X
At this point startx should start xmonad and show you your downloaded image as background.

This is a very very bare bones configuration which is supposed to be iterated. There’s still many things that can be done on top of this
- X windows is not starting automatically after you login. This is a good thing to change or even, if you prefer, use a display manager;
- emacs is still not configured or themed;
- xmobar can be tweaked even more;
- And there’s more applications to install (from the top of my head: firefox, java, node, intellij, clementine, vlc).

In the meantime, if you want to peek into some of these files, check my dot files repository on github.

For now the foundation is laid - a very minimal and super fast Linux with a windowing system which just gets out of the way. :-)
